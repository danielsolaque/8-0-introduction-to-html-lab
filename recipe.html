    <h2> Description </h2>

    <p>Arepa is derived from the indigenous term Erepa, which means corn. Arepa is a corn griddle cake made from pre-cooked cornmeal,
     it is popular in Colombia and Venezuela, where it is served daily with a variety of toppings to complement them. They were 
    traditionally prepared in a pan known as a budare. However, they can be grilled, fried, or baked as well.</p>

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 Lb Cornmeal </li>
        <li>4 Coups of Water </li>

    <h2> Directions </h2>

    <ol>
        <li>If the corners crack easily or the dough feels too dry, moisten with a little additional water.</li>
        <li>Tender, moist arepas can be made by adding a little oil to the dough.</li>
        <li>By shaping a bit of the dough to verify its consistency before adding extra water, you can avoid dense and gummy arepas.</li>
        <li>You’ll need a nonstick griddle or skillet for this recipe. If you do not have one, you can use a cast-iron skillet and lightly grease it before cooking each arepa.</li>
        <li>Use a knife to cut arepas down the center but leave the back ends attached and stuff your favorite stuffing.</li>
        <li>Before stuffing an arepa, it’s common to smear butter inside. It’s completely optional, but it’s highly suggested.</li>
     </ol>
